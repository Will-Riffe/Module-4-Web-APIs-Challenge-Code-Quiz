# Web Development Quiz
Webpage for testing budding web developers

## Summary
It is sometimes necessary to guage the extent of someones knowledge in a field they're studying. Therefore, this very simple quiz has been developed in order to test the rudimentary knowledge of someone who is new to web development.

## Features
This webpage is a code quiz game that starts when the user clicks the start button. A timer will begin counting down, and the user will be presented with a series of questions. When a question is answered, another question will appear. If an answer is incorrect, time will be deducted from the clock. The game will end when either all questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero. At the end of the game, the user will have the option to save their initials and their score.
